# School-Management-System
Platform for school departement , the platform was made to make to automate actions like managing student ,teachers, modules and  grades and calculating the final assement and sending it via email.
First ever project i have worked on so the code is so messy and files are not very good named, and the design is so basic .
I will make sure to make the project better and better with each update.
Few things you should note :
You need to create a dataabse and name ot bddg8.
I didn't make a landing page (i will) , so openning page is (login.php).
Create a admin user and user and login .
A student can't edit anything he can only see his grades and assignment and send it via email.
The admin can (search,add,edit,update,delete) student,teacher,modules,note.
View all the tables in database.
Display the statistics.
Assign a user infomation to each platform user.
Send assignnent via email
